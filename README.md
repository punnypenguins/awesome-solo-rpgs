# Awesome Solo RPGs
A list of Solo RPGs I've found and liked from around the internet, gameplay resources and tools, and some links to playthroughs people have recorded or written down.

## Solo RPGs

I made this post to share with friends who want to get into solo RPG playing, and I figured I might as well post it here too in case anyone loves reference lists like I do and feels like looking through this even though there are already awesome rec lists on this sub!

Objects you may or may not need, depending on the game:

* 52 card deck
* Jenga tower
* Physical or digital paper/notebook
* Normal dice
* DnD dice
* Tarot card deck (standard/traditional major and minor arcana)
* Art supplies

All the games in this post are either free or pay-what-you-want (letting you get them for free if you want). Have fun looking through the sub-sections! Hope you enjoy some of the games. :)
